# new-project-portfolio

check it out here : https://preston-project-portfolio.netlify.app

this is an updated version of my previous protfolio updated with what i have learnt while learning html and css, (and being apart of hack club!)

the website opens to the homepage where you see glimpese of my interests, projects, and about me. 

you can either click on the buttons on the top bar to be redirected to the inerest, about, or project page, or you can click the buttons on the corosponding sections to also be redirected.

this project is my way of showing off what i have learnt, while showing all my projects ive made over these 2 months!

i hope you enjoys looking through this website!
